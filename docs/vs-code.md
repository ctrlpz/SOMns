## VS Code to Develop with the SOMns Language

Currently, we provide IDE support for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
The SOMns support can be installed via the
[VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MetaConcProject.SOMns).

The extension provides support for:

 - syntax highlighting
 - parse errors
 - code navigation
 - code completion
 - basic linting
 - CodeLens for running minitests
 - and debugging of SOMns programs

This support is based on the
[Language Server Protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol#readme)
and could be used in other IDEs as well, but we do not currently provide
extensions for them. It is however confirmed to work with NetBeans and Eclipse.
