   |- nodes                           # AST and dispatch node implementations
   |- objectstorage                   # SOMns object model implementation
   |- actors, processes, transactions # core elements of concurrency models
|- primitives        # Basic operations, exposed via vmMirror object to SOMns
|- vm                # Basic VM setup, startup, and object system initialization
|- vmobjects         # Representation for build-in object and arrays
|- VM.java           # Java entry point and bridge between interpreter and tools

tools
|- debugger          # Connection to the Kompos Web Debugger
```

## Code Layout: Tests

```bash

|- replay            # Tests for the deterministic replay feature
|- superinstructions # Tests for the super-instruction candidate detector
```

## Code Layout: SOMns

```bash
core-lib
|- Benchmarks       # Collection of various benchmarks
|- TestSuite        # Collection of tests
   |- BasicInterpreterTests  # Minimal tests only executable as JUnit tests
   |- Minitest.ns            # Newspeak's Minitest framework

|- System.ns                 # Minimal API to access system functionality
|- Threading.ns              # Threading and fork/join-related classes
|- Transactions.ns           # Software transactional memory classes
```

## Code Layout: Kompos

Kompos is a web-based debugger integrated into SOMns. It is based on Truffle's
language agnostic debugger support and extends it to provide actor-specific
debugging facilities. It is implemented in TypeScript.

Note that Kompos and the VS Code debugger share the TypeScript code that is
used to interface with the Java backend.

```bash
/tools/kompos/
|- index.html            # The HTML elements for the debugger
|- package.json          # NPM package definition
|- src
   |- breakpoints.ts     # Breakpoint related code
   |- controller.ts      # MVC controller to connect model and view
   |- debugger.ts        # Debugger model to manager state needed in UI
   |- history-data.ts    # Model for the actor message history
   |- main.js            # Main JS file used from HTML frontend
   |- messages.ts        # Definitions of messages exchanged with SOMns interpreter
   |- view.ts            # The HTML view code
   |- visualizations.ts  # Visualizes actor interactions as graph
   |- vm-connection.ts   # Web socket connection to the SOMns interpreter

|- tests                 # Tests debugger interaction with SOMns, including some SOMns integration tests
|- tsconfig.json         # TypeScript config
|- tslint.json           # TypeScript lint settings
```
